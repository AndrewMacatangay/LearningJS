//Javascript has evolved without compatibilty issues. Existing code could never
//break but bad decisions by the creators would be kept forever. In 2009, new
//features were added and modified some of the existing code. To keep the old code
//working, the special directive "use strict" was added.

//This directive removes silent errors and promotes safe code. It can be used
//globally and/or within the context of a function.
"use strict";
